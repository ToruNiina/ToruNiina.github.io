            </div>Watch Star Fork Have you ever heard of a game called &ldquo;SEPARO&rdquo;? Probably not. It is a board game designed by my friend, Takashi Suwa, when he was a high school student. Some of his friends, including me, were interested in it and played it many times using a blackboard in a classroom.
It is clearly a brilliant board game. Several weeks ago, I suddenly remembered and got the urge to play this game.]]></description></item></channel></rss>
